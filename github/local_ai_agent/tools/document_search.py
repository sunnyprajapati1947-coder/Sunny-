"""Semantic search over the user's own documents.

Off by default (config.rag_enabled, env AGENT_ENABLE_RAG=1).

Two tools reach the model: `search_documents` and `list_documents`. Indexing,
removing and rebuilding do not - they are done from the CLI (`python -m rag`)
or the API. That is the same boundary every other tool in this project draws:
the model reads, a person decides what to change. It also keeps two more tool
definitions out of a prompt that is re-processed at a few tokens per second.

The description on `search_documents` is doing real work. The requirement is
that "according to my biology notes, explain photosynthesis" searches and
"what is 25 x 17?" does not, and on an 8B model that distinction is made
entirely by the sentence the model reads before deciding. So it names the case
it is for and the cases it is not, rather than describing the mechanism.
