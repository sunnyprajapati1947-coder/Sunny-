"""OCR with a choice of backend: the GLM-OCR model, or Tesseract.

`OCR_BACKEND` picks between them, and they are genuinely different trades
rather than one being better:

                      RAM        one page      understands layout
    GLM-OCR         ~1.4 GB      ~30 s         yes - tables, columns, headings
    Tesseract       ~50 MB       <1 s          no - lines of text, in order

Tesseract is the default because most OCR here is "read the text off this
screenshot", and paying 1.4 GB and half a minute for that on an 8 GB machine is
a poor trade. GLM-OCR earns its cost on a page whose structure matters.

Everything above the backend is shared: the same workspace jail, the same size
and extension checks, and one `ocr_image` tool whose description changes to
match whichever backend is active - so the model is told what it is actually
getting.

The model backend is documented below.


VERIFIED against a running server (GLM-OCR-Q8_0 + mmproj-GLM-OCR-Q8_0):
the endpoint below returns correct transcriptions, /props reports
{"vision": true, "video": true, "audio": false}, and a 760x300 note takes
about 30 seconds on this machine.

llama.cpp serves vision models through mtmd, and its OpenAI-compatible endpoint
takes images as content parts on a user message:

    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "text",      "text": "..."},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,..."}}
    ]}

One quirk worth knowing: GLM-OCR emits tables as HTML (<table><tr><td>)
whatever format you ask for. The data is accurate; the markup is not
negotiable. The default prompt avoids mentioning tables at all, because doing
so makes the model wrap even plain lines in table markup.

The tool refuses early and clearly when the server is not multimodal, so a
missing projector produces an explanation rather than a puzzling failure.
