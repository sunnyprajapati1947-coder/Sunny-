"""Restricted Python execution for computational work.

SECURITY NOTE - READ BEFORE ENABLING
------------------------------------
This tool is DISABLED by default (config.python_tool_enabled, env
AGENT_ENABLE_PYTHON_TOOL=1).

What it actually does:
  * screens the model's code with `ast` first, rejecting imports, dunder names
    and attributes, and calls to open/eval/exec/compile/__import__/getattr and
    friends;
  * runs the code in a SEPARATE process (`python -I -S`) with a stripped
    __builtins__, a temporary working directory, a wall-clock timeout and an
    output cap.

What it is NOT: a sandbox. CPython was never designed to contain hostile code
in-process, and a determined escape from a restricted-builtins namespace is a
known class of trick. The separate process and the AST screen raise the cost of
an escape and stop the obvious attempts; they do not make it safe to run code
from an untrusted source.

So: leave it off unless you need it, and if you turn it on, understand that you
are trusting the model's output roughly as much as you trust code you paste
into a terminal yourself. Real isolation means a container, a VM or a seccomp
jail, and that is a deliberate follow-up rather than something faked here.

RUNNING SCRIPT FILES
--------------------
`run_python_file` runs a .py file from the workspace. By default it applies the
same screen and the same stripped child as an inline snippet - being on disk
changes nothing about what the code may do.

AGENT_PYTHON_UNRESTRICTED=1 drops all of that and runs plain CPython with
imports, the venv's packages and the filesystem. There is no honest middle
ground: a script that cannot import anything is not much of a script, and
pretending a filtered interpreter is safe would be worse than saying plainly
that this one is not. It is a second, separate opt-in on top of enabling the
tool at all, and it refuses to run when the workspace is the project directory
- otherwise a script could simply rewrite the agent's own source and remove
every other guard.
