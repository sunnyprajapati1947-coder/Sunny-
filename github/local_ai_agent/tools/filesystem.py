"""Filesystem tools, confined to a configured workspace.

Reading and listing are always available. Writing is off unless enabled, and
even then only creating files and directories exists - there is no delete,
rename, move or chmod path anywhere in this module.

Every model-supplied path is resolved first and then checked against the
workspace root, which is what makes the check hold against '..' segments,
absolute paths and symlinks that point outside.

One extra guard applies to writing. The workspace defaults to the project
directory, so without it the agent could rewrite tools/base.py - the very code
that enforces every other tool's limits - or its own registry, and silently
disable the lot. PROTECTED_TOP_LEVEL keeps the agent's own source out of reach
even when the workspace contains it. A workspace pointed somewhere else
entirely is still the safer arrangement.
